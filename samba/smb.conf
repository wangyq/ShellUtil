  ;The write cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks

  ;Setting min receivefile size allows zero-copy writes directly from network socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache (if available). 
  ;It may improve performance but user testing is recommended:
  min receivefile size = 16384

  ;Reading/writing files asynchronously may improve performance instead of using synchronously writes

  ;Increasing the receive/send buffers size and socket optimize flags might be useful to improve throughput. 
  ;It is recommended to test each flag separately as it may cause issues on some networks:
